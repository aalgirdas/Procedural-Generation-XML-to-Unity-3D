# Procedural-Generation-XML-to-Unity-3D

In this repository you can find UNITY resource files that you can use to create a simple block world and animate it.
Elements in an XML file are timestamped in seconds.
The system clock starts after you hit the play button in the UNITY editor.  It starts executing the ItemLoader.cs script. 

## Motivation

The main motivation for this project is the development of a visual debugger for semantic parsers. The semantic parser must identify the physical objects in the sentence and instantiate them in the scene. The **.\Assets\Resources\items_files\items.xml** XML file is used as a bridge between the semantic parser and the 3D semantic information debugger.
